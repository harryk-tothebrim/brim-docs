The white paper(OCPP Security Ed. WhitePaper) describes how the security enhancements, introduced in OCPP 2.0, can be used, on top of OCPP 1.6-J, in a standardized way.

#### Security Objectives

OCPP security has been designed to meet the following security objectives:
1. To allow the creation of a secure communication channel between the Central System and Charge Point. The integrity and confidentiality of messages on this channel should be protected with strong cryptographic measures.
2. To provide mutual authentication between the Charge Point and the Central System. Both parties should be able to identify who they are communicating with.
3. To provide a secure firmware update process by allowing the Charge Point to check the source and the integrity of firmware images, and by allowing non-repudiation of these images.
4. To allow logging of security events to facilitate monitoring the security of the smart charging system.
